# ⚡ ULTRA-SIMPLE WINDOWS SETUP - Copy-Paste Commands

## 🎯 For Your Demo - Just 3 Steps!

---

## ✅ **What Happens Automatically:**

When you run `launch.bat`, it will:
1. ✅ Create virtual environment automatically
2. ✅ Install ALL dependencies automatically (from requirements.txt)
3. ✅ Launch the app automatically

**You don't need to worry about virtual environments or pip install!**

---

## 📋 **Complete Setup (Copy-Paste These):**

### **STEP 1: Install Python** (One-time, 5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. Download: **Python 3.11.x** or **Python 3.12.x** (the big yellow button)
3. Run installer
4. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Check the box "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Done!

**Python versions that work:**
- ✅ Python 3.11.x (Recommended)
- ✅ Python 3.12.x (Also good)
- ❌ Python 3.13.x (Too new, avoid)
- ❌ Python 3.10.x (Old, bug fixes only)

---

### **STEP 2: Download Project & Run** (One command!)

**Open Command Prompt** (Win + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)

**Then copy-paste this ENTIRE block:**

```cmd
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop && git clone https://github.com/rajchheda242/CommuniGate_ISL.git && cd CommuniGate_ISL && launch.bat
```

**That's it!** ✨

The `launch.bat` script will:
- Create virtual environment (`.venv` folder)
- Install all dependencies
- Launch the app
- Open browser automatically

**First time takes 3-5 minutes** (installing dependencies)

---

### **STEP 3: Future Runs** (10 seconds!)

After the first setup, just:

```cmd
cd CommuniGate_ISL
launch.bat
```

**Or simply:** Double-click `launch.bat` in the folder!

---

## 🤔 **Don't Have Git?**

### **Option A: Install Git**
1. Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Install with default options
3. Use commands above

### **Option B: Download ZIP**
1. Go to: https://github.com/rajchheda242/CommuniGate_ISL
2. Click green "Code" button → "Download ZIP"
3. Extract to Desktop
4. Open folder
5. Double-click `launch.bat`

## ✅ **Checklist for Demo Day:**

### **On Their Windows Computer:**

- [ ] Install Python 3.11 or 3.12 (with "Add to PATH" checked)
- [ ] Open Command Prompt
- [ ] Paste: `cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop && git clone https://github.com/rajchheda242/CommuniGate_ISL.git && cd CommuniGate_ISL && launch.bat`
- [ ] Wait 3-5 minutes
- [ ] App opens in browser
- [ ] Test one gesture
- [ ] **Demo!** 🎉

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**

### **"Python is not recognized"**
→ Reinstall Python, make sure "Add to PATH" is checked

### **"Git is not recognized"**
→ Use Option B (Download ZIP) above

### **Dependencies fail to install**
→ Make sure internet is connected
→ Try: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
→ Then run `launch.bat` again

### **Port already in use**
→ `taskkill /F /IM streamlit.exe`
→ Try again
